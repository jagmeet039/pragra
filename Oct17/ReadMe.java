    showing only essential features and hiding implementation
    process of hiding details
    eg : Math class or all ready defined

    Two ways to achieve
    1. Abstract classes
    2. Interfaces

    Abstract
        - any class which is declared with abstract keyword
        - we cannot create object of abstract class
        - it can have both abstract and non-abstract methods

    abstract method
        - doesn't have body
        - public abstract void makeSound();

    Interfaces
        - similar to class
        - by default its public and abstract
